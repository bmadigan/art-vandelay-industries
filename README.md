## Art Vandelay Industries

This is a Laravel 11 application using the TALL Stack (Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire).

***This will be a continued work in progress ...***

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `composer install`
3. Run `php artisan migrate:fresh`
4. Run `php artisan db:seed`
5. Run `npm install`
6. Run `npm run dev`

### Auth Credentials

As I got tired of logging in after a fresh migration, I updated the Auth Login to
automatically login using any credentials. But this application is not intended
for security and mostly to show how I like to structure my Laravel applications.

***So go ahead and login with any credentials***
